# Twitter Profile Analyzer with LangChain

## Project Overview

Build an intelligent agent using LangChain and LLMs that allows you to input any public Twitter profile link or handle, automatically analyzes tweets, and provides an in-depth review including:
- Key tweet styles and topics
- Popular/viral tweet insights
- Main hook lines used
- Types of replies the user posts
- Sentiment, trends, and utility recommendations

---

## Features

- **Profile-Based Tweet Fetching**
  - Input a Twitter profile link or username, fetch latest tweets and their metrics.
- **Engagement Analytics**
  - Find and summarize the profile’s most popular tweets (likes, retweets, engagement).
- **Hook Line & Writing Style Extraction**
  - Identify and summarize common opening phrases, hook lines, and rhetorical styles.
- **Theme & Topic Identification**
  - Cluster tweets by topics using embeddings and LLM categorization.
- **Reply Behavior Analysis**
  - Classify and summarize the types of replies the user posts (supportive, humorous, confrontational, etc.).
- **Sentiment Analysis**
  - Rate tweet and reply sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Trend Observation**
  - Detect recurring content patterns, peak times, or trending topics engaged by the user.
- **Visual Summaries**
  - Tabular and, optionally, graphical representations of key findings.
- **Actionable Recommendations**
  - Suggest what hooks, timings, or topics could further drive engagement.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**
- Install Python, LangChain, OpenAI (or other LLM provider), Tweepy (for Twitter API access), and database/vector DB if clustering required.
- Get Twitter OAuth2 Bearer Token for API access.

### 2. **Collect Tweets and Replies**
- Use `TwitterTweetLoader` from LangChain or Tweepy to fetch recent tweets and their metadata (profile, likes, retweets, time, etc.)
- Pagination or repeated queries for larger profiles.

### 3. **Preprocess Data**
- Structure tweets and replies into LangChain Documents.
- Clean and chunk tweet text if necessary for analysis.

### 4. **Build Feature Pipelines using LangChain**
- **Popular Tweet Analysis**: Filter tweets by top engagement; pass to LLM for context and style analysis.
- **Hook Line Extraction**: Chunk tweet text and use an LLM chain to extract recurring openers.
- **Topic/Thematic Clustering**: Use embeddings and similarity search to group by topic.
- **Reply Analysis**: Collect and concatenate user replies, use prompt templates to classify reply tone/type.
- **Sentiment and Style Summary**: Run sentiment/model summary chains.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Use output summaries to prompt LLM for improvement suggestions.

### 5. **Build Visualization or Reporting Layer**
- Present findings in tables (e.g., Pandas, Markdown).
- Optionally, plot charts (matplotlib, Streamlit, Dash) for engagement data and trends.

### 6. **Run the Complete Analysis Pipeline**
- Accept Twitter profile as input.
- Automate pipeline: Fetch → Analyze → Summarize → Present.
